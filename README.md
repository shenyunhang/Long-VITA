## ✨ Highlights

- **Long Context**. Long-VITA can process more than 4K frames or over 1M visual tokens. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on Video-MME under 20B models.
- **Open Source**. Long-VITA is trained on open-source data only, consisting of a mix of 17M samples that are publicly available.
- **Strong Performance**. Long-VITA achieves competitive results on image and video understanding benchmarks among cutting-edge models under 20B parameters.
  

## 📈 Experimental Results
- **Comparison of image understanding**.
